Multithreaded Integer Sorting Program

Description

This program reads a list of integers from an input file, sorts them using a multithreaded approach, and writes the sorted list to an output file. The program utilizes two sorting threads that each sort half of the array, followed by a merging thread that combines the sorted subarrays into a fully sorted array.

Files Included

main.c: The main C source code containing the sorting and merging logic.
IntegerList.txt: The input file containing a list of integers separated by commas (not provided; create this file manually).
SortedIntegerList.txt: The output file that will be generated by the program, containing the sorted list of integers.
Features

Uses multithreading to divide the sorting task into two separate threads.
Implements Bubble Sort in each thread.
Merges the two sorted halves into a final sorted array.
Reads input from IntegerList.txt and writes output to SortedIntegerList.txt.
Prerequisites

A C compiler (e.g., gcc).
POSIX thread library (pthread).
How to Compile and Run the Program

1. Compilation
Use gcc to compile the program with the -pthread flag for multithreading support:

bash
Copy code
gcc main.c -o sorter_program -pthread
2. Prepare the Input File
Create a file named IntegerList.txt in the same directory as the executable. The file should contain integers separated by commas, for example:

Copy code
12,45,23,8,56,34,78,15,89
3. Run the Program
Run the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./sorter_program
4. Check the Output
After running the program, a new file SortedIntegerList.txt will be created in the same directory. This file will contain the sorted list of integers, for example:

Copy code
8,12,15,23,34,45,56,78,89
Troubleshooting

Error: Could not open IntegerList.txt: Ensure that the IntegerList.txt file is in the correct directory (same as the executable) and has read permissions.
Error: Could not create SortedIntegerList.txt: Ensure that you have write permissions for the directory.
How the Program Works

Reading Input: The program reads integers from IntegerList.txt.
Thread Creation: Two threads are created to sort the two halves of the array using Bubble Sort.
Merging: A third thread merges the sorted subarrays.
Output: The sorted array is written to SortedIntegerList.txt.
